# Neovim(nvim) Config

This repo contains my personal nvim config written in lua.

Feel free to copy anything you see here, but please understand i'm no expert.

Likewise if you have any suggestion to improve my config feel free to let me know.

## Things I can never remember
shift + `<` or `>` for indenting blocks of code
ctrl + `o` when in insert mode allows you to move one space using `h,k,l,m`
